# Anna Skoulikari Creative Projects Documentation (Work In Progress)

Just like [Seth Godin, I have always seen my life as a series of creative projects](https://seths.blog/2014/07/thirty-years-of-projects/).


Here is a curated list of creative projects by me, Anna Skoulikari, in reverse chronological order which will be updated as I go along.

## 2019 Web developer job search journey 

I approach all of my job searches like mini creative projects. And I have a lot of job search journeys because I explore careers like an anthropologist. 

In my web developer job search journey, I chose to use the power of the video medium to communicate the skills I had gained from the coding bootcamp I attended.

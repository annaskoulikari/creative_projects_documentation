# Anna Skoulikari Creative Projects Documentation (Work In Progress)

Just like [Seth Godin, I have mainly viewed my life as a series of creative projects](https://seths.blog/2014/07/thirty-years-of-projects/).


Here is a curated list of creative projects by me, Anna Skoulikari, in reverse chronological order which will be updated as I go along.

### Book trailer - [Learning Git Book Trailer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAbERXgwzwU)

More than a year after my first book (Learning Git) was published, I finally go around to partnering with a videographer [Ieva Galginaite (IGV Productions)](https://www.igvproductions.com/) and making a fun and playful trailer for it. 

I wrote the script which used a cooking metaphor, bought the props, and we got together in the studio to shoot.

For two years, I worked on writing a book teaching the basics of Git using the colors of the rainbow, visuals, hands-on exericses, and storytelling.

## 2019 Web developer job search journey 

I approach all of my job searches like mini creative projects. Since I explore careers like an anthropologist, I have a lot of job search journeys. 

In my web developer job search journey, I chose to use the power of the video medium and [made a video showcasing the project I had built whle attending a coding bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWesF6zGkWo).

## 2018 UX designer job search journey 

My UX job search journey took place in London after I had completed a 3 month intensive UX design bootcamp. My creative problem was how to stand out amongst tons of other brilliant junior UX designers in London. So I decided to create [a video CV](https://youtu.be/HkIIrJKXZl0) rather than just relying on a regular A4 PDF CV. And I wrote in-depth case studies for the three ([1](https://medium.com/anna-skoulikari/project-1-deki-and-the-mobile-app-in-depth-case-study-c7bca4eca76c) [2](https://medium.com/anna-skoulikari/project-2-palmersville-training-and-the-responsive-website-in-depth-case-study-62adc1704d0d) [3](https://medium.com/anna-skoulikari/project-3-funky-spaces-and-the-website-optimisation-in-depth-case-study-6c0296be9f80)) hands-on projects I had worked on while at the bootcamp and posted them on Medium
